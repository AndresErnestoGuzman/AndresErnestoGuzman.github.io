      <h1>Signal leakage and interference in ALMA</h1>
      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>The ALMA receivers are affected in some antennas by radio frequency interference coming from several sources. The most common of these are the local oscillator (LO) of the waver vapor radiometer (WVR), the yttrium iron garnet (YIG), and the second local oscillator (LO2). In the following we will focus on the WVR LO leakage (or WVR leakage for short) as the treatment and underlying phenomenon seems to be similar to that of the other leakages. The general internal reference within ALMA for information about this problem is collected in the non-conformant report #120 (JIRA ticket <a href=https://jira.alma.cl/browse/NCR-120>NCR-120</a>).<p>

      <h2> Phenomenology and detection </h2>
      <p>The WVR leakage is detected most of the times in the bandpass spectrum, usually as a narrow line feature seen in absorption in the bandpass calibration table. Particularly strong interference is also be evident in emission the system temperature (Tsys) spectrum. Because  observations  with the main 12m array use a lower spectral resolution for Tsys measurements, the spectral signature of the leakage is wider in the Tsys spectrum than that observed in the bandpass. The Tsys leakage signal affects the calibration creating sometimes wide "wings" seen in the bandpass solution. All this features are evident in the example shown in Figure (1a) and (1b).  After calibration, almost none of these features are seen. Part of the reason is that the leakage seems to be more of less stable (or only slowly variable).

    <h3>Leakage signal in the auto-correlations and cross-correlations</h3>
    <p> One of the characteristics of the leakages is that they are more evident in the auto-correlations, where they appear as a positive peak, rather 
    than in the cross-correlations, where they appear as absorption features. The latter is the reason why they appear as absorption features in the bandpass solutions.
    The reason for this is explained by R. Hills (report attached in NCR-120) 
    <blockquote>
      "In the normalized cross-correlation (bottom left) there is a negative spike. This is as expected because the WRV LO frequencies are different (by design) and so do not correlate, but the presence of the spike is suppressing the correlated signal from the quasar since the normalization is done by dividing by the geometric mean of the auto-correlation functions."
    </blockquote>
These features can be observed in the following plots.

    <h3>Leakage signals in the cubes</h3>
    <p>The effect of the leakage in the image cubes is a bit more subtle  because of the following reasons:
      <ul>
        <li>As far as we have seen, the leakage affects the phase calibrator and the source scans. The effect on the cross-correlations is qualitatively similar on all fields, which means that the effect is partially canceled out by calibration, specifically, by the bandpass calibration. </li>
        <li> During image deconvolution, we combine the cross-correlation signals from many antennas, affected in various degrees by the leakage problem :from heavily affected to not at all. 
        </li>
        <li> Because the extraneous leakage signal affects the cross-correlation only through the auto-correlation normalization, in the visibilities this is mainly a  <i>calibration</i> problem affecting some channels. This means that the cross-correlation amplitudes that are multiplied by wrong calibration factors. A consequence of this is that continuum subtracted cubes (such as the ones analyzed in the weblogs) should not display any spurious "line emission," but such a feature may be observable in the RMS spectrum or in non continuum-subtracted cubes. 
            </li>
      </ul>

        </figure>
  </p>
  <p>We evaluate the effect of the leakages on (non-continuum subtracted) image cubes  of the phase calibrators. We evaluated these for several sources observing the following:
    <ul>
      <li>The RMS measured in regions away from the source (see Figure 5) show an increase in the leakage region consistent with what is shown  by  Figure (4) in the source cube. </li>
      <li>The integrated flux in a region around the source seem to follow the same behavior  as the RMS, increasing near the leakage frequency. However, this is not observed in the  spectra of the smaller region nor in the spectra taken at  the peak flux density of the source.  </li>
      </ul>

      <h2> Simple theoretical model</h2>

     <p>A simple theoretical picture of the leakage will be presented. Consider the radio signal received from a quasar (the bandpass calibrator) coming from a point source whose electric (or magnetic) field complex amplitude can be represented by:
      \begin{equation}
      E(t) = a e^{i(2\pi  \nu t -\varphi)}~~,\label{eq-1}
      \end{equation}
      where the frequency \(\nu\) is a random variable with probability density function \(f_\nu\propto S_\nu\). This function will not be used in the following, but, if necessary, we may assume (as it is observed) it is a negative power law of frequency over the frequency range of interest. Because emission from the quasar comes from many electrons emitting synchrotron incoherently, we add a random phase \(\varphi\) distributed uniformly in \([0,2\pi)\) and independent from \(\nu\). The constant \(a\) is related with the total 
      integrated spectrum through \(a^2=\int_{-\infty}^\infty S_\nu d\nu\). 
     </p>
    <p>The autocorrelation of \(E(t)\) is (Papoulis, ยง10):
      \begin{equation}
      R(\tau) = a^2\,\mathbb{E}(e^{2\pi i \nu \tau})=a^2\,\int_{-\infty}^\infty f_\nu(\nu)e^{2\pi i \nu \tau}d\nu~~.\label{eq-2}
      \end{equation}
      We assume that the leakage injects a monochromatic signal on each antenna of the form
      \[
       L_j e^{i(2\pi \bar{\nu}_j t - \alpha_j)}~~,
      \]
      for each antenna \(j=1,2\), with constant \(\bar{\nu}_i\) and a random phase \(\alpha_j\).
      In general, as mentioned above, \(\bar{\nu_1}\neq\bar{\nu_2}\).
      <figure style="width:50%;max-width:512px;"> 
          <img src="Astronomy/alma/diagram_leaks.png" alt="Leakage diagram" style="width:100%;max-width:512px;">
          <figcaption>Figure (7). Diagram of leakage process contaminating astronomical signal for two antennas. </figcaption>
        </figure>
      </p>
    <p>
      Based on Equation (\ref{eq-1}), the signals received at antenna \(j=1,2\) is :
      \begin{equation}
      E_j(t) = a e^{i(2\pi  \nu t -\varphi)}+L_j e^{i(2\pi \bar{\nu}_jt)}~~.\label{eq-3}
\end{equation}
Note that \(E_j(t)\) is no longer an stationary process, but cyclostationary with a deterministic component, i.e., the constant phase leakage signal. We will remove the explicit dependence on \(t\) by averaging in time after the correlator, as indicated in the diagram in Figure (7). 
</p>
  <p>
    The  auto-correlation of \(E_j\) is:
    \begin{equation}
    R_{jj}(\tau) = \langle\mathbb{E}\left(E_j(t+\tau)E_j^*(t)\right)\rangle_t = \lim_{T\rightarrow \infty}\frac{1}{2T}\int_{-T}^{T} \mathbb{E}\left(E_j(t+\tau)E_j^*(t)\right)dt = a^2 \,\mathbb{E}\left(e^{2\pi i \nu \tau}\right) + L_j^2 
    \,e^{2\pi i \bar{\nu_j} \tau}~~, \label{eq-autocorr}
    \end{equation} 
    because \(\mathbb{E}\left(e^{i(2\pi  \nu t-\varphi)}e^{-2\pi i \bar{\nu}_j}\right)=\mathbb{E}\left(\mathbb{E_\varphi}\left(e^{i(2\pi  \nu t-\varphi)}e^{-2\pi i \bar{\nu}_j}|\nu\right)\right)=0\), that is, the cross terms between the leakage signal and the astronomical signal do not correlate. 
    This lack of  correlation (even at \(\nu=\bar{\nu}_j\)) comes explicitly in our model from the fact that the leakage signal has constant phase, in contrast with the random phase of the astronomical signal. 
    Even if the leakage signal has a random non-zero phase, it would be characterized by a phase independent of the astronomical signal, not changing the fact that the cross terms in the correlations would be zero. 
    The autocorrelation spectrum (the Fourier transform of the autocorrelation) from \eqref{eq-autocorr} is 
    \begin{equation}
    S_{jj}(\nu) = a^2 f_\nu + L_j^2 \delta(\nu-\bar{\nu}_j)~~.\label{eq-5}
    \end{equation}
  </p>

<p>
      To cross-correlation between the signals from antennae 1 and 2 is 
     \[
      R_{12}(\tau)=\mathbb{E}\left(V_1(t+\tau)V_2^*(t)\right)~~.
    \]
      Note that the term \(\left(L_1e^{i(2\pi \bar{\nu}_1(t+\tau))}L_2e^{-i(2\pi \bar{\nu}_2t)}\right)\) is removed by 
      the time averaging assuming that the time interval over which the signal is integrated is large compared with \(|\bar{\nu_1}-\bar{\nu_2}|^{-1}\).
      <!-- \begin{equation}
      \mathbb{E}\left(L_1e^{i(2\pi \bar{\nu}_1(t+\tau)-\alpha_1)}L_2e^{-i(2\pi \bar{\nu}_2t-\alpha_2)}\right) = 0
      \end{equation} -->
      Therefore:
      \begin{equation}
      \begin{split}
      &                & R_{12}(\tau) &= a^2 \,\mathbb{E}\left(e^{2\pi i \nu \tau}\right)\\
      &\longrightarrow & S_{12}(\nu)      &= a^2\,f_\nu \\
      \end{split}\label{eq-6}
