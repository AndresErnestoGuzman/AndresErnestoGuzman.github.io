      <h2>Spectral resolution and Hanning smoothing in ALMA.</h2>
      <p>
        The autocorrelation signal from where the spectrum is derived is modified 
        by a symmetric window function called a Hann window. We will denote  \(w \leftrightharpoons W\), repectively, 
        the Hann window function in the lag-autocorrelation domain and its Fourier transform, 
        in the frequency domain. That is 
        \begin{equation}
                \int_{-\infty}^\infty w(x) e^{-2\pi i x f} dx = W(f)~~.\label{eq-fourier}
        \end{equation}
      </p>
       <p>
        Explicitely, Hann window and its Fourier transform are 
      \begin{equation}
      \boxed{w(x/T)=\begin{cases}
      \cos^2\left(\pi x/T\right)&|x/T|\le 1/2\\
      0& \neg \end{cases} }\leftrightharpoons \boxed{\frac{T\sin(\pi \xi)}{2\pi \xi(1-\xi^2)}=W(fT)T}~~,\label{eq-fourier-hann}
      \end{equation} 
      where the \(\xi=f T\) and the FWHM of the function on the right is \(2/T\).
      We will refer to the function on the left (in the lag-autocorrelation domain)
       as the "Hann-window" and the second (in the frequency-spectral domain) as the "Hann-function."
    </p>

    <p>We will assume that the astronomical spectral signal consist of a deterministic signal plus white noise, that is, 
    \begin{equation} S  = \mathcal{D}+\partial B(\sigma^2)\label{eq-S}~~,\end{equation} 
    where the white noise has the property that, for two square integrable functions \(g\) and \(h\),
    \begin{equation}
    {\rm cov}\left(\int_{-\infty}^\infty g(f)\partial B(\sigma^2) (f) df,
    \int_{-\infty}^\infty h(f)\partial B(\sigma^2) (f) df\right)=
        \sigma^2\int_{-\infty}^\infty g(f)h(f)df~~.\label{eq-cov}
        \end{equation}
      In particular, this means that the signal averaged over a square filter of width \(\Delta f\) has variance 
   \begin{equation}
   {\rm var}\left(\int_{\Delta f}\left(\frac{1}{\Delta f}\right)S(f)df\right)=\frac{\sigma^2}{\Delta f}~~.\label{eq-var}
   \end{equation}

 Since in the following we will be mostly interested in the noise of the signal, we will assume \(\mathcal{D}\equiv 0\).</p>
  <p>
    Refer to the figure below. It represents a section of an spectrum with noisy channels. The 
    value of each channel is given by the convolution of the Hann-function with the true spectrum, represented in gray. 
    Note that the true effective bandwidth of each channel depends on the FWHM of the convolution function, and that this
    convolution creates some statistical correlation between channels.

    <figcaption><em>The red curve shows the Hann-function  with an FWHM = \(2\Delta \nu\), where \(\Delta\nu\) is the channel size.
    The value of each channel represents the convolution of the true signal (\ref{eq-S}, represented by the noisy 
  gray line in the background) with the Hann-function.</em></figcaption>

<p>We will define the effective bandwidth of a filter analogously as the width \(\Delta f\) 
  appears in the case of a square filter (\ref{eq-var}):
  \begin{equation}
  \effbw{f} = \frac{\sigma^2}{\var\left( W \star S\right)}~~, \label{eq-effbw}
  \end{equation}
  where \(\star\) represents convolution and the integral of the filter function \(W\) 
   is assumed to be 1. Therefore, the effective bandwidth of the Hann-function filter is 
  \begin{equation}\effbw{f} = \frac{\sigma^2}{\sigma^2 T \int^\infty_{-\infty}W(\xi)\star W(\xi)d\xi}
            = \frac{1}{T}\int_{-T/2}^{T/2}\cos(\pi x)^4dx 
            = \frac{8}{3T}=\frac{4\,{\rm FWHM}}{3}~~.
  \end{equation}
  In particular, if the FWHM is two times the channel size, \(\effbw{f}=(8/3)\times\Delta\nu \approx 2.667 \times\Delta\nu\).
