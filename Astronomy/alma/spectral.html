      <h2>Spectral resolution and Hanning smoothing in ALMA.</h2>
      <p>
        The autocorrelation signal from where the spectrum is derived is modified 
        by a symmetric window function called a Hann window. We will denote  \(w \leftrightharpoons W\), repectively, 
        the Hann window function in the lag-autocorrelation domain and its Fourier transform, 
        in the frequency domain. That is 
        \begin{equation}
                \int_{-\infty}^\infty w(x) e^{-2\pi i x f} dx = W(f)~~.\label{eq-fourier}
        \end{equation}
      </p>
       <p>
        Explicitely, Hann window and its Fourier transform are 
      \begin{equation}
      {w_T(x)=w(x/T)=\begin{cases}
      \cos^2\left(\pi x/T\right)&|x/T|\le 1/2\\
      0& \neg \end{cases} }\leftrightharpoons {\frac{T\sin(\pi \xi)}{2\pi \xi(1-\xi^2)}=W(fT)T = W_T(f)}~~,\label{eq-fourier-hann}
      \end{equation} 
      where  \(\xi=f T\) and the FWHM of the function on the right is \(2/T\).
      We will refer to the function on the left (in the lag-autocorrelation domain)
       as the "Hann-window" and the second (in the frequency-spectral domain) as the "Hann-function."
    </p>

    <p>We will assume that the astronomical spectral signal consist of a deterministic signal plus white noise, that is, 
    \begin{equation} S  = \mathcal{D}+\partial B(\sigma^2)\label{eq-S}~~,\end{equation} 
    where the white noise has the property that, for two square integrable functions \(g\) and \(h\),
    \begin{equation}
    {\rm cov}\left(\int_{-\infty}^\infty g(f)\partial B(\sigma^2) (f) df,
    \int_{-\infty}^\infty h(f)\partial B(\sigma^2) (f) df\right)=
        \sigma^2\int_{-\infty}^\infty g(f)h(f)df~~.\label{eq-cov}
        \end{equation}
      In particular, this means that the signal averaged over a square filter of width \(\Delta f\) has variance 
   \begin{equation}
   {\rm var}\left(\int_{\Delta f}\left(\frac{1}{\Delta f}\right)S(f)df\right)=\frac{\sigma^2}{\Delta f}~~.\label{eq-var}
   \end{equation}

 Since in the following we will be mostly interested in the noise of the signal, we will assume \(\mathcal{D}\equiv 0\).</p>
  <p>
    Refer to the figure below. It represents a section of an spectrum with noisy channels. The 
    value of each channel is given by the convolution of the Hann-function with the true spectrum, represented in gray. 
    Note that the true effective bandwidth of each channel depends on the FWHM of the convolution function, and that this
    convolution creates some statistical correlation between channels.  
    <figure>

    <figcaption><em>The red curve shows the Hann-function  with an FWHM = \(2\Dnu\), where \(\Dnu\) is the channel size.
    The value of each channel represents the convolution of the true signal (\ref{eq-S}, represented by the noisy 
  gray line in the background) with the Hann-function.</em></figcaption>
</figure>
</p>

<p>We will define the effective bandwidth of a filter analogously as the width \(\Delta f\) 
  appears in the case of a square filter (\ref{eq-var}):
  \begin{equation}
  \effbw{f} = \frac{\sigma^2}{\var\left( W_T \star S\right)}~~, \label{eq-effbw}
  \end{equation}
  where \(\star\) represents convolution and the integral of the filter function \(W\) 
   is assumed to be 1. Therefore, the effective bandwidth of the Hann-function filter is 
  \begin{equation}\effbw{f} = \frac{\sigma^2}{\sigma^2 T \int^\infty_{-\infty}W(\xi)\star W(\xi)d\xi}
            = \frac{1}{T\int_{-T/2}^{T/2}\cos(\pi x)^4dx }
            = \frac{8}{3T}=\frac{4\,{\rm FWHM}}{3}~~.
  \end{equation}
  In particular, if the FWHM is two times the channel size, \(\effbw{f}=(8/3)\times\Dnu \approx 2.667 \times\Dnu\).
</p>   
<p> That is the usual situation in ALMA. The Hanning-function used to filter the spectral signal has a FWHM 
of two channels, which means that the effective width of each channel is actually \(8/3\) times the channel width. 
In addition, the default spectral setting includes binning of two channels. </p>

  <p> Determining the variance and noise properties of the addition of several channels
  entails knowing the covariance between the signals measured at different frequencies. 
  Note that the  Hanning-function extends to infinity, so in principle signals separated 
  by an arbitrary amount are always correlated to some degree. This is not actually the case when the 
  channel size is conmensurate with the FWHM of the Hanning-function, as we will see.
  The covariance between signals observed at frequencies \(f_1\) and \(f_2\), separated by \(\df\), 
  is given by 
  \begin{equation}\begin{aligned}
  \cov\left((W_T \star S)(f_1), (W_T \star S)(f_2)\right) &= \cov\left(\int_{-\infty}^\infty T W(T f_1-T f) S(f) df,  \int_{-\infty}^\infty T W(T f_2-T f) S(f) df \right)
    &= \sigma^2 T^2 \int_{-\infty}^\infty W(T f_1-T f) W(T f_2-T f)df  \\
    &=  \sigma^2 T \int_{-\infty}^\infty W(-\xi) W(T \df-\xi)d\xi \\
    &=  \sigma^2 T \int_{-\infty}^\infty W(\xi) W(T \df-\xi)d\xi  =  \sigma^2 T \, (W\star W)(T\df)~~.\label{eq-cov-WT}
  \end{aligned}\end{equation}
  With the help of the fact that  \((W\star W) \leftrightharpoons w^2\), we derive 
  \[ (W\star W)(\xi)  = \frac{3 \sin (\pi  {\xi})}{2 \pi {\xi} ({\xi}-2) ({\xi}-1)  ({\xi}+1) ({\xi}+2)}~~,\]
  thus
  \begin{equation} 
  \cov\left((W_T \star S)(f_1), (W_T \star S)(f_2)\right) = \sigma^2 T  \frac{3 \sin (\pi  {\df T})}{2 \pi {\df T} ({\df T}-2) ({\df  T}-1)  ({\df  T}+1) ({\df T}+2)}~~.
  \end{equation}
  The last equation is general, but we focus on \(\df\) conmensurate with \(T\), particularly, when \(\df = m\Dnu\)
   and \(\Dnu={\rm FWHM}/2=1/T\). In this case,
   \begin{equation}\cov\left((W_T \star S)(f+m\Dnu), (W_T \star S)(f)\right) 
   = \frac{\sigma^2}{\Dnu}
   \begin{cases}
  3/8 & m=0\\
  1/4 & |m|=1\\
  1/16 & |m|=2\\
  0 & \neg
   \end{cases}~~.\label{eq-cov-chan}\end{equation}
  </p>

  <p> Using (\ref{eq-cov-chan}), we can calculate the variance of the average signal of \(N\ge2\) <em> adjacent</em> channels
  \begin{equation}
  \var\left(\frac{1}{N}\sum_{k=0}^{N-1} (W\star S)(k \Dnu)\right) = 
    \frac{\sigma^2}{N^2\Dnu} \left( N\frac{3}{8} + 2 \left(
    (N-1)\frac{1}{4}+(N-2)\frac{1}{16} 
    \right)\right) = \frac{\sigma^2}{N^2\Dnu} \left(N-\frac{3}{4}\right)~~.\label{eq-var-Nchan}
  \end{equation}
  With this equation we can finally derive the effective number of channels of the sum of \(N\) adjacent channels where each signal comes from 
  a Hanning filtered spectrum with a FWHM of two channels:
  \begin{equation}
  { N_{\rm eff}} = \begin{cases} \frac{8}{3} & N=1 \\ \frac{N^2}{N-\frac{3}{4}} & N>1\end{cases}~~.
  \end{equation}
  We can compare the numbers obtained with this formula with those given <a href="https://safe.nrao.edu/wiki/pub/Main/ALMAWindowFunctions/Note_on_Spectral_Response.pdf">here </a>
